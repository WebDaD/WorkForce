# workers

this is the list if workers and what the do. also we have the list of commands

Workers can be put into categories, but every worker may do everything.

Categories:
- DirectAction -> Only sends an event after receiving a command
- WatchDogs -> They send events on particular things they watch
- WorkStarter -> They start something
- Communicator -> Used to purly fiddle with messages

## pingw

this one just sends a ping and returns ok or not

### commands
- ping


## intercomw

this one nows all workers (by Configuration) and will redirect messages to the correct target by name. it also can return the target of any worker and a list of connected ones. it takes a msg and reads the command. based on this it will select a worker and send the msg to it.
It also can distribute events, so a worker can just subscribe to a specific event here, the intercoma will then subscribe (if not already) and add the worker to its own distribution list.

### commands
- list
- getAddress

## tunnelw

Takes a Msg, rewrites the receiver to another tunnelw (configure) and writes the receiver into the command. then it opens a tcp conntection and sends the message. the other tunnel reads the msg, gets the original msg, replaces the sender and performs. reads the answer and sends it back to the original tunnelw. this reads the msg, replaces the sender and returns the value to the original sender.

### commands
- getPartner
