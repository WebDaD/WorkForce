this is about combining watchers and other ablati to create workflows with chains

- A watcher send a message
- A subscribed ablati receives and does something. Where does this message go? 

I guess there should be an ablatus called chaina:

A Chain is:
- A1: Event
- C: Notifiy A2
- A2: perform, notify C
- C: do something, like its an Event

The chaina can have multiple chains, as it will fork for every new chain.
